# @gccaedits IP address ranges

### Description

This repository contains the configurations for the IP ranges used for [@gccaedits](http://twitter.com/gccaedits), and is the new home of the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ruebot/605426d052168156ba37) file used for community contributions.

The original set of IP address came from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_IP_addresses).

`ranges.json` is part of a larger [config](https://github.com/edsu/anon/blob/master/config.json.template#L8-L20) file for [anon](https://github.com/edsu/anon), the software behind [@gccaedits](http://twitter.com/gccaedits).
